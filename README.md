## Description

This project allows a user to manipulate and append a list of 3 database tables. Right now, of the 7 features, my project can do 4 of them. I will be resubmitting this for sure, by the end of this week I plan to have ALL of my assignments submitted, including last weeks. I know I am very close.

## Installation

First, you need to clone the github repo. Then, in the same folder as "server.js", you need to run two commands: "npm i install" and "npm i inquirer@8.2.4". watch the video for any help. 

## Usage
When you start using this, you first need to run "mysql -u root -p" and then you run these commands in this order: "source db/schema.sql", "source db/seeds.sql", and then "source db/query.sql". After that then you can run the program and use the arrow keys to select options.

## Testing

I didnt write any tests for this program.

## Contributing

I am the only one contributing to this project; no one else can. It also can only be cloned, it wont be deployed.

## Credits

For this project, I used a lot of the Activity 28 from module 12, which I will continue to use until I have it done.
